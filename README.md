`git-draw` draws nearly the full content of a tiny git repository as a graph. For example after the following few git commands

	git init
	echo 'hello world' > greeting.txt
	git add greeting.txt
	git commit -m 'initial commit'
	git tag R1 -m R1
	echo 'bye bye' > parting.txt
	git add parting.txt
	git commit -m 'added parting'
	echo 'welcome' > greeting.txt
	git add greeting.txt

`git-draw` will display the following image

	NAME
	  git-draw - draws nearly the full content of a tiny git repository as a graph

	SYNOPSIS
	  git-draw [OPTION]...

	PREREQUISITES
	  You don't need all of these if you use git-draw with certain options.

	  - graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/)
	  - imagemagick (http://www.imagemagick.org)

	  If you have apt you can install these with:

	    sudo apt-get install graphviz imagemagick

	DESCRIPTION
	  git-draw is composed of three main steps, where the 2nd and 3rd are just for
	  convenience and are not part of git-draw's core responsibility.

	  1) A .dot file describing the repository's content as a graph is created.
	  2) dot (see graphviz) is called to produce an image out of that .dot file.
	  3) display (see imagemagick) is called to display that image.

	  The current working directory must be at the root of the working tree of
	  your project, i.e. the directory which contains the .git directory.

	  The intention is to help learning Git's basic concepts (references, Git
	  objects, SHA-1 checksum over content as id). Virtually all information
	  concerning Git's basic concepts is contained in the drawing. Thus git-draw
	  is aimed at tiny toy Git repositories and at users with an engineer
	  background, i.e. users which are not scared off by terms like checksum,
	  references aka pointers and graphs.

	OPTIONS
	  -p, --print-only
	    Only prints the .dot file to STDOUT. Mutually exclusive with --image-only.

	  -i, --image-only
	    Only generates an image of the graph, and a .dot file beforehand. Mutually
	    exclusive with --print-only.
